# Binarii Labs – Brand Context

## What we do
Binarii Labs provides Data Security as a Platform (DSP) that secures unstructured data by automatically duplicating, encrypting, fragmenting and distributing every file across multiple user-owned cloud locations.

No single provider ever holds a complete file. This ensures data remains inaccessible in a breach and continuously available during outages.

We eliminate data loss by design – not detection.

## Core problem we solve

Over 80% of enterprise data is unstructured, poorly classified and highly exposed to breach, insider threat and cloud failure.

Traditional DLP detects and blocks. It does not prevent loss if infrastructure is compromised.

Cloud redundancy still stores complete files in single environments, creating single points of failure.

Regulations such as NIS2 and DORA now push accountability to executive level – yet most organisations cannot guarantee:
- Data sovereignty
- Continuous availability
- Immutable proof of file activity

---

## Our solution in simple language

Instead of trying to monitor data and stop it leaking, we make it impossible to steal in the first place.

Every file is automatically:
1. Duplicated
2. Encrypted
3. Fragmented
4. Distributed across at least three storage locations the client owns and controls

No location ever contains a complete file.

If one cloud is breached or goes down, attackers only see useless encrypted fragments – while the business maintains uninterrupted access.

Every action on every file is time-stamped via immutable Proof of Record for audit and compliance validation.

## Differentiators

1) Prevention by architecture – not detection  
We secure the data itself, not just the infrastructure around it.

2) True sovereign multi-cloud control  
Clients choose and own their cloud locations. No single provider ever becomes custodian of a full file.

3) Immutable Proof of Record  
Blockchain-anchored, tamper-proof logging of every file action for audit, governance and regulatory defence.

4) Business continuity built in  
Continuous uninterrupted access even during breach or cloud outage.

5) Zero user friction  
No tagging. No policy management. No complex DLP rule tuning.

We talk about eliminating exposure.
