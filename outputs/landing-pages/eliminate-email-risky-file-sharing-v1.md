### Headline options (choose 1)
1. **Every Email Attachment Creates a Permanent Compliance Risk. Stop Sending Copies.**
2. **If You Email Sensitive Files, You’ve Already Lost Control of Them.**
3. **End File Copy Sprawl: Share Sensitive Data Without Creating New Copies.**

**Subheadline**
Binarii Labs helps regulated teams share sensitive datasets without uncontrolled duplication. Enforce revocation, prove access history, and keep PHI, IP, and AI data governable from first share to final deletion.

## Problem Story: “The File Got Forwarded 8 Times”
A compliance lead sends a spreadsheet with patient-linked records to one approved vendor contact.

Within 24 hours:
- The vendor forwards it to legal.
- Legal forwards it to external counsel.
- Counsel forwards it to a contractor.
- A contractor downloads it to a personal drive to “work faster.”
- Someone shares a snapshot in WhatsApp to ask a question.
- Another person uploads it to a consumer AI tool for analysis.

By end of week, that one file has been forwarded **8 times** across inboxes, drives, chats, and unknown devices.

Now ask:
- Who currently has a copy?
- Which copy is latest?
- Which copies were deleted?
- Who accessed what, and when?

No one can answer with certainty. Audit trails are fragmented. Revocation is impossible. Risk is compounding silently.

## Why Email Sharing Is a Compliance Nightmare
- **Email attachments create permanent, uncontrolled copies** the moment they are sent.
- **Forwarding multiplies files infinitely** across organizations, devices, and personal tools.
- **No true revocation:** once downloaded, copies persist outside policy control.
- **No reliable deletion proof:** “Please delete” is not governance.
- **No complete audit trail:** inbox logs ≠ end-to-end chain of custody.
- **Shadow IT fills gaps:** personal drives, WhatsApp, consumer file tools, and unsanctioned AI uploads.
- **Most leaks are accidental, not malicious**—ordinary workflows create extraordinary exposure.
- **AI datasets, PHI, and IP become ungovernable** once copy sprawl starts.

## How Copy Sprawl Happens (Visual Explanation in Text)
**One file. One click. Infinite risk.**

```text
[Source File]
   ↓ attach to email
[Recipient Inbox Copy]
   ↓ forward
[Forwarded Inbox Copy 1] → download → [Laptop Copy]
   ↓ forward
[Forwarded Inbox Copy 2] → upload → [Personal Drive Copy]
   ↓ share link in chat
[Chat Attachment Copy] → screenshot/export → [Untracked Copy]
   ↓ “quick AI analysis”
[Consumer AI Upload Copy]

Result: Multiple uncontrolled replicas, no single source of truth,
no guaranteed revocation, no end-to-end evidentiary audit trail.
```

## The Binarii Labs Approach
**Share access, not copies.**

Binarii Labs replaces attachment-based distribution with **controlled, no-copy sharing** built for regulated operations:
- **No-copy sharing model:** users access governed data without proliferating standalone files.
- **Controlled access:** role- and policy-based permissions by user, dataset, context, and time.
- **Encrypted distribution architecture:** data is secured by design across client-controlled infrastructure.
- **Revocation and expiry:** instantly remove access, expire sessions, and enforce policy changes in real time.
- **Immutable proof of record:** time-stamped, tamper-resistant activity evidence for audits and investigations.

---

## How It Works
1. **Classify the sharing workflow** (patient records, partner exchange, AI datasets, internal review).
2. **Define access policy** (who, what, when, where, and for how long).
3. **Distribute securely through Binarii controls** instead of sending attachments.
4. **Track every access event** with immutable, compliance-ready logging.
5. **Revoke or expire instantly** when project scope, vendor status, or risk posture changes.
6. **Produce defensible audit evidence** for regulators, clients, and internal governance.

## Comparison: Traditional Sharing vs Binarii

| Capability | Email Attachments / Dropbox / Drive | Binarii Labs Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Sharing model | Send/duplicate files | Controlled access without copy sprawl |
| Forwarding risk | Unlimited re-sharing | Policy-bound access controls |
| Revocation | Not reliable after download | Immediate access revocation/expiry |
| Deletion assurance | Best effort only | Governed lifecycle with evidence |
| Audit trail | Fragmented across tools | Centralized immutable proof of activity |
| Shadow IT exposure | High | Reduced via secure, usable alternative |
| AI/PHI/IP governance | Breaks after uncontrolled sharing | Persistent governance throughout lifecycle |
| Compliance readiness | Manual, reactive, hard to defend | Proactive, evidentiary, audit-ready |

---

## Use Cases
- **Patient records sharing:** collaborate across care, legal, and payer stakeholders without uncontrolled copies.
- **AI training data governance:** control access to sensitive datasets used by internal and external ML teams.
- **Vendor data exchange:** share regulated files with suppliers/partners while preserving revocation and auditability.
- **Internal cross-functional collaboration:** legal, security, operations, and analytics teams work from governed access.

## FAQ

### 1) Can we revoke access after sharing?
Yes. Binarii enforces policy-based access controls with revocation and expiry, so access can be removed instantly as risk or scope changes.

### 2) Can we set automatic access expiry?
Yes. You can apply time-bound access windows and enforce expiration by project, user role, or partner context.

### 3) Do we get complete audit logs?
You get immutable, time-stamped records of file activity suitable for compliance evidence, incident review, and governance reporting.

### 4) Will this integrate with our current environment?
Binarii is designed for regulated teams and can align with existing cloud and security workflows while replacing risky attachment-based processes.

### 5) Will this slow down teams?
No. The goal is to remove risky workarounds and give teams a secure workflow that is easier than email-and-forward behavior.

### 6) Is this only for malicious insider threats?
No. It is built for real-world operations where most leaks are accidental. Binarii reduces everyday workflow risk, not just intentional abuse.
