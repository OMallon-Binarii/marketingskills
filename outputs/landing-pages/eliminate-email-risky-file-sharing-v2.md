2. **Email Files Once. Lose Control Forever.**
3. **Stop Sending Sensitive Files. Start Sharing Controlled Access.**

**Subheadline**  
Email and consumer file tools create uncontrolled copies you can’t revoke, delete, or fully audit. Binarii Labs gives regulated teams no-copy sharing, instant revocation, and immutable audit evidence.

## The Problem Story: “One File Became 8 Uncontrolled Copies”
A compliance manager emails one file with sensitive patient-linked data to one approved vendor contact.

Then normal work happens:
- Forward to legal.
- Forward to external counsel.
- Download to a laptop.
- Upload to a personal drive to “move faster.”
- Share in WhatsApp for quick feedback.
- Paste into a consumer AI tool for analysis.

By Friday, the file has spread to **8+ copies** across inboxes, drives, chats, and unknown devices.

Now leadership asks:
- Who has it right now?
- Which version is authoritative?
- Can we revoke every copy today?
- Can we prove full chain-of-custody to an auditor?

With attachment-based sharing, the honest answer is usually: **No.**

---

## Why Email Sharing Is a Compliance Nightmare
- **Attachments create permanent uncontrolled copies** the second you hit send.
- **Forwarding multiplies copies infinitely** across people, vendors, and tools.
- **No real revocation:** once downloaded, copies live outside your control.
- **No true deletion:** requests to delete are not enforceable proof.
- **No complete audit trail:** mailbox logs do not equal end-to-end evidence.
- **Shadow IT fills the gaps:** personal drives, WhatsApp, and consumer apps.
- **Most leaks are accidental, not malicious**—caused by routine work.
- **PHI, IP, and AI datasets become ungovernable** once copy sprawl starts.

## How Copy Sprawl Happens (Visual)
**One send creates a chain reaction.**

```text
[Original Sensitive File]
      ↓ attach to email
[Inbox Copy #1]
      ↓ forward
[Inbox Copy #2] → download → [Device Copy]
      ↓ forward
[Inbox Copy #3] → upload → [Personal Drive Copy]
      ↓ share link in chat
[Chat Copy] → export/screenshot → [Unknown Copy]
      ↓ “quick AI prompt”
[Consumer AI Upload]

End state: many copies, many locations, no reliable control.
```

## Binarii Labs Solution: Share Access, Not Copies
Binarii replaces send-and-forward workflows with **controlled no-copy access** for sensitive files.

### What changes immediately
- **No-copy sharing:** collaborate without creating uncontrolled file replicas.
- **Policy-based access:** define who gets access, to what, for how long.
- **Encrypted distribution by design:** protect data across client-controlled cloud locations.
- **Instant revocation and expiry:** remove access in seconds when context changes.
- **Immutable Proof of Record:** time-stamped, tamper-resistant logs for audits and investigations.

---

## How It Works
1. **Map a high-risk workflow** (e.g., patient records to external counsel).
2. **Set policy controls** (users, purpose, time window, and restrictions).
3. **Share through Binarii access controls** instead of email attachments.
4. **Monitor every access event** with immutable activity records.
5. **Revoke or auto-expire access** when projects end or risk changes.
6. **Export defensible evidence** for audits, incidents, and board reporting.

## Comparison Table

| Capability | Email / Dropbox / Drive | Binarii Labs |
|---|---|---|
| Core model | Duplicate and send files | Share controlled access |
| Forwarding control | Practically none | Policy-bound permissions |
| Revocation after send | Unreliable | Immediate and enforceable |
| Deletion confidence | Manual and uncertain | Governed lifecycle with evidence |
| Audit trail quality | Fragmented across systems | Immutable, centralized proof |
| Shadow IT pressure | High | Reduced with safer workflow |
| PHI/IP/AI governance | Breaks as copies spread | Maintained through lifecycle |
| Compliance readiness | Reactive, hard to defend | Proactive, audit-ready |

---

## Use Cases
- **Patient records:** share sensitive health data across approved stakeholders without uncontrolled copies.
- **AI training datasets:** govern access to proprietary or regulated data used for model development.
- **Vendor sharing:** give third parties controlled access without losing chain-of-custody.
- **Internal cross-functional teams:** legal, security, operations, and data teams collaborate without risky workarounds.

## FAQ

### Can we revoke access after sharing?
Yes. Access can be revoked instantly based on policy, user status, or incident response needs.

### Can access expire automatically?
Yes. Set fixed expiry windows by workflow, partner, team, or data class.

### Do we get audit logs suitable for regulators?
Yes. Binarii provides immutable, time-stamped activity records designed for audit and governance evidence.

### Will this work with our existing stack?
Binarii is designed to fit regulated cloud environments and replace high-risk attachment workflows without heavy user friction.

### Will teams resist this change?
Adoption improves when secure sharing is easier than unsafe workarounds. Binarii is built for day-to-day usability, not policy theater.

### Is this only for insider-threat scenarios?
No. It primarily addresses accidental leakage from normal workflows—the most common real-world risk.
